# Hiring Exercise: Generic Cut Up


## Audience
This exercise is for front end web developers. 

## Objective
Show us your front end development skills and thought process. 

Imarc's front end developers work with designers and engineers throughout the production cycle. A big part of this (on a typical marketing site), is translating the designer's Photoshop comp(s) into markup.

The front end developer strives to match the comp as pixel-perfect as possible. However, we might only be working from a desktop design, so the front end dev makes decisions on how to best reflow the layout for different screen sizes. 

Delight – any interactions and progressive enhancements are usually brainstormed with the team and implemented by the front end dev. With this exercise, however, since you're working in a silo, feel free to add whatever level of sizzle and delight that you deem fit.

## Timeframe
Spend around 5 hours taking this Photoshop comp as far as you can... or want. We're really looking for insight into your work style and thought process as a front end developer. 

- Maybe you want to get the entire page worked out just like the comp – *great!*
- Maybe you'd rather focus on the top half of the design but add some progressive enhancements and animations – *also great!*
- Maybe you're new to this and are just trying to figure out a solid layout – *still great!*

## What To Do

1. Download the attached Photoshop file, `generic-layout.psd`. We also provided a static jpg if that's easier.
2. Per the objectives above, translate that design comp into markup – an actual web page, or part of the page with all the HTML, CSS, JS, and anything else you want.
3. Try to stick to the timeframe limit. We'd rather see a realistic representation of what you can do in the alloted timeframe even if it's not near where you want it to be.
4. Share your work with us – either post the finished result on the web and share a link with us; or zip up all your work and send us the files (We'd need all the assets so we can just drag your `index.html` file into a local browser and it all works.)

### Notes
Feel free to use andy CSS framework or Javascript libraries or plugins that you see fit. We certainly don't expect you to start from absolutely nothing. If you have a favorite bootstrapping starting point, please use it.
