# Hiring Exercise: Generic Cut Up


## Audience
This exercise is for front end web developers. 

## Objective
Show us your front end development skills and thought process. 

Imarc's front end developers work with designers and engineers throughout a project's cycle. A big part of this
(on a typical site), is translating the designer's comp(s) into mark-up and css.
  
## Requirements
* Styles should use SCSS and be compiled down to CSS. We typically use Laravel Mix, but use whichever method of
 compilation you're comfortable with.
* The page should look correct and work well in all modern browsers as well as Internet Explorer 11.
* The page should be responsive across screen sizes from 380px wide to 1400px wide. The front end developer strives to
 match the comp as pixel-perfect as possible. However, we might only be working from a desktop design, so the front
 end dev sometimes makes decisions on how to best reflow the layout for different screen sizes.
* *Interactions* – any interactions and progressive enhancements are usually brainstormed with the team and
 implemented by the front end developer. Some interactions are shown in the comp, however, since you're working in a
  silo, feel free to add whatever other interactions or sizzle that you deem fit.

## Timeframe
Spend around 5 hours taking this Photoshop comp as far as you can... or want. We're really looking for insight into
 your work style and thought process as a front end developer.
 
 It's not required that you finish the whole page and we won't judge you for not. Rather, we want to see your
  work process and organization in as real a way possible 

## What To Do
1. Download the attached XD file, `generic-layout.xd`. We also provided a static jpg if that's easier.
2. Per the objectives above, translate that design comp into mark-up – an actual web page, or part of the page with
 all the HTML, CSS, JS, and anything else you want.
3. Try to stick to the timeframe limit. We'd rather see a realistic representation of what you can do in the allotted
 timeframe even if it's not near where you want it to be.
4. Share your work with us – zip up all your work and send us the files (We'll need all the assets, compiled files
 etc, with the expectation that we can just drag your `index.html` file into a local browser and have it all work).

### Notes
We certainly don't expect you to start from absolutely nothing. If you have a favorite bootstrapping starting point, please use it.

If you have any questions at all, definitely reach out to ask.
